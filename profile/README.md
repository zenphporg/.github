# Zen PHP Application Platform

Zen is an enterprise-level PHP platform and ecosystem built on the foundations of Laravel, and designed for corporations, startups, and organizations that require a highly opinionated, structured, type-safe, and scalable application framework.

Our mission is to provide a powerful, enterprise-ready PHP framework that combines the simplicity and elegance of Laravel with the robustness and scalability required by large-scale organizations.

We aim to streamline the development process, enhance code quality, and promote best practices in PHP application development.
